It illustrates the functioning of the law at this level in relation to cases in corruption, in contrast to failures to prosecute higher level instances of corruption. The company audit revealed a problem, the case was brought to court, evidence was produced and the individual was prosecuted and ordered to pay a fine equivalent to the amount taken from the company and two months imprisonment.

He was sentenced to a fine and to pay compensation to the girl's relatives and advice was taken from customary authorities on the amounts. This case highlights the failure to address a statutory rape case as such, instead treating it as relating to underage pregnancy. It is useful to compare with how similar cases are handled in customary courts, since the judge appears to have taken into account customary law when decided upon sentencing.

The plaintiff is accusing the defendant of causing the death of her unborn child after they fought at a water point and the plaintiff later had a miscarriage. This case demonstrates the unique tensions that can arise in the PoC that customary courts must resolve, without necessarily having the medical infrastructure and expertise needed to make an evidence based decision. This case was recorded by observer GP.",

The defendants are ‘street children’ who are being accused for murdering one of their peers in a fight. These children were not given any legal representation in court, limiting the ability of statutory courts to deliver a fair trial especially since the defendants were minors.
