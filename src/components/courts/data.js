        summary: `The case concerns a failed attempt by the plaintiff to separate his daughter from the defendant who impregnated her. This is one of the rare cases in our records where a customary court gave a ruling based on the preference of a woman instead of her relatives.`,
        comment: `Comment 
This case was heard in a customary court (B) in Nimule on 18 May 2016. The plaintiff asked the court to separate his daughter from the defendant who impregnated her. Customary law typically mandates that relatives have the right to decide who their children marry, but this case proves to be an exception to that rule. 

In line with the precedent of similar cases, the plaintiff attempted to use the customary court to ensure his daughter obeyed his wishes. He argued that his daughter’s pregnancy would put a stop to her education, which she should have been allowed to continue. This is a common concern for parents that appears in other court records. It highlights the tension between valuing women’s education, yet potentially limiting their abilities to make decisions for themselves. 

The plaintiff also accused the defendant of raping his daughter. The court record does not give any further details regarding this, and it does not seem to factor into the ruling. However, it’s important to note that sexual assault cases are supposed to be heard in statutory courts. Like many of the court records that feature sexual assault, it is not the focus of the case. Rape or sexual assault may also be framed as ‘impregnation’ or ‘elopement’ in customary courts. 

When asked her opinion, the woman said the defendant was her husband, and what her father was doing was just a complication. The judge ruled according to the daughter’s statement that she accepted the accused as her husband despite her parents’ wishes to the contrary. The defendant was fined 500SSP ($1.75) for ‘impregnating a school girl’ and was ordered to pay 30 cattle to the family of the girl, in accordance with the law of the Dinka community.

This case is unusual because the judge made the ruling based on the daughter’s preference, not her father’s: “the judgement was passed according to her opinion.” While customary courts typically reproduce patriarchal gender norms, this case demonstrates the potential for customary courts to be a site for producing new gender norms.`,

        summary:
          "This case concerns a dispute over the identity of a girl-child’s father, and the custody of the child. It is an example of the innovative ways that statutory courts, like customary courts, use traditional rituals to solve disputes.",
        comment: `The case was heard in a statutory county court in Rumbek on 8 October 2015.  The plaintiff is the brother-in-law of the defendant, brother to the defendants’ wife. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant’s wife had a previous relationship before marrying the defendant, and their 15-year-old daughter is not the defendant’s child. In some examples of Dinka customary law, if a father does not pay a fine or bridewealth for a child born outside of marriage, then it is considered that the child belongs to another male relative. 

The defendant argued that he is the father of the child, and that the plaintiff lied in order to gain custody of the child, so he could later marry her off for cattle. The defendant’s argument is indicative of a view of women as commodities in South Sudanese society,  whereby the ‘ownership’ of the child can be disputed in terms of her role as a financial asset. 

The case also demonstrates how customary law is utilised in statutory courts, as well as customary courts. Whilst the resolution of such a dispute would usually require a paternity test, in this instance the court noted that DNA tests were unavailable. In order to settle the case, the statutory court employed a creative solution more commonly associated with customary courts. It ruled that the mother of the child must be put under a “traditional oath” that “involves magic under which the person taking the oath will either win or die in the process, depending if you lie.” 

The court observer notes that some of the audience were skeptical, because only the woman can know the truth, which is a clear limitation of this strategy. However, without the option of DNA testing, the use of a “traditional oath” was accepted by all parties as a means of settling the dispute.`,

The case demonstrates how customary courts often function as a first point of contact for members of the community seeking support for problems around addiction and mental health. This case was recorded by observer JTA in Rumbek town.",
        comment: `This case was heard in a customary town court in Rumbek on 12 January 2016. It was brought to court by a woman seeking help for her husband's alcoholism. The case gives an insight into how communities use customary courts to deal with issues around addiction and mental health. While customary courts are typically male dominated, this case is another example that women do bring cases to customary courts, which can provide an avenue for them to seek assistance. 

In the aftermath of the civil war, mental health issues affect a large portion of the population and currently health services are inadequate and mental health services are almost non-existent. Customary courts often function as a first point of contact for community members who are seeking help with addiction. The woman, accompanied by her brother-in-law, pleaded that the court should imprison her husband in order to “rehabilitate him and save his life.” 

Without any other alternative, people turn to customary courts for help because they are fundamentally rooted in the community. In this instance, the chief is sympathetic to both the plaintiff and her husband. The husband is sentenced to six months in prison, with the promise of an early release if he shows signs of improvement. While this is not a substitute for adequate mental health and addiction services, it demonstrates how chiefs, as judges in customary courts, can provide some sort of support despite the limited resources available. 

Overall this case demonstrates the multiple roles customary courts play within communities. They are not just courts that resolve disputes, they are important institutions within communities that people turn to for guidance and support. `,

        summary:
          "This case concerns a theft alleged to have taken place during an outbreak of conflict between members of the Fertit community and Dinka soldiers in the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA). It highlights how customary courts continue to function through times of conflict, and how they navigate the ethnic tensions that arise.",
        comment: `The case was heard in a customary court in Wau on 2 March 2016 after an outbreak of violent conflict. From late December 2015, Wau had started to see a rise in tensions between the Fertit tribe who are local to the area, and the majority Dinka SPLA forces. Tensions between the Dinka and the Fertit were manifest during the conflict in Wau. They were associated with increasingly intense outbreaks of violence throughout 2016, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths and huge numbers of people being displaced.  

The complainant claimed that he was told that the accused had broken into and looted his house. The complainant was Dinka, and the accused was Fertit, making the case a very sensitive matter in the context of heightened tensions. The accused claimed the witness was spreading false rumours, and that at the time of the offence he had alibi, as he was helping to protect civilians from the conflict. The judges postponed making a ruling on the case because it involved “tribal conflict.”

The significance of this case is in the fact that, despite the conflict, the case was heard in court only five days after the outbreak of fighting. This demonstrates the real strength of customary courts: by drawing their authority from the communities they are embedded in, they do not require a functioning state apparatus. 

This case demonstrates how customary courts continue to function through times of conflict and unrest. While other branches of the judicial system can cease to function, customary courts have persisted throughout the various conflicts in South Sudan. While the case is not resolved, the fact that it was heard in a timely fashion demonstrates the potential of customary courts to resolve inter-tribal disputes, rather than fueling them.  Limited though it may be, the courts display the potential to ease tribal tensions.`,

          "The case concerns theft inside the Protection of Civilians’ site (PoC) administered by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which the accused had confessed to after being beaten by the N4 (local security group). It highlights both the shortcomings of the UN peacekeeping project in failing to prevent the use of corporal punishment (a breach of human rights), and the limited authority customary courts have over security groups like the N4.",
        comment: `The case was heard in a customary court on 21 February 2016 in Juba PoC3. The defendant, aged 16 at the time, was accused of stealing a door from a latrine. The defendant confessed to the crime after being beaten by the N4, a local security group. The judgement confirmed the accused was guilty of theft, and that the correct punishment (‘uncountable beating’) had already been carried out at the time by the N4 security force. 

The court report makes reference to the recording of the confession. It states: “he was physically punished, you can hear his voice carrying loudly on the recorder.” The accused is also threatened with further beatings if he repeats the crime. The use of corporal punishment by security forces in the Juba PoC has also appeared in court records of similar cases. These cases demonstrate the shortcomings of UNMISS in upholding the international human rights regime. 

This case also raises questions about the relationship between the customary courts and the N4 security force. The N4 should surely be subject to chiefly authority, yet the court’s influence over the security force is unclear. In this case, it seems that a beating administered by the N4 during an interrogation was legitimised by the court ruling. 

Finally, the court record gives an insight into the insecurity in the PoC and how quickly incidents can explode into violence. The defendant tried to steal the door because his own house was lacking a door and he didn’t feel safe. When the N4 arrived, people were beating and throwing stones at the defendant for trying to take the door. This reveals the difficult living conditions in the PoC, combined with UNMISS’ shortcomings in regards to security. It demonstrates the rationale for customary courts existing  in the POC sites, given the need for mechanisms to prevent disputes and outbursts of violence from escalating wherever possible.`,

        comment: `The boy was found guilty of stealing but was not given a sentence (he was forgiven) on the grounds that he acted “under pressure of hunger”. It’s unclear whether he was adequately represented in court or whether he had to represent himself. Regardless, it is notable that the court took into account his social and economic situation and motivations for stealing, particularly in a statutory court. The case highlights how aspects of the customary court system, which recognises social obligations to provide for hungry members of the community in “hunger courts”, can inform the legal system as a whole.

        summary:
          "This case concerns a murder charge brought to court by a public prosecutor on behalf of the deceased. The defendants are ‘street children’ who were accused of murdering one of their peers in a fight. The children had no legal representation in court. The case highlights the  limited ability of the statutory court to deliver a fair trial, especially where defendants are minors.",
        comment: `This case was brought to Wau North High Court on the 5 February 2016. Evidence submitted by both the prosecution and the accused indicated that the children had been in a street fight and the deceased had been involved. It was submitted that after the fight, the accused brought the deceased to the police station for medical attention, unaware that he had died. The accused submitted that other members of their peers who had not attended the trial had been the ones to throw stones at the deceased and had later run away, whilst those accused had brought the deceased to the police station.  

The children were found guilty of being “collaborators to murder.” The court records indicate this conclusion was reached as the accused could not justify their claim that those responsible for the murder had run away. The children were sentenced to six months in a reformatory centre and to pay blood compensation of 31 cows.

A crucial factor in the significance of this case is that the children did not have any legal representation, while being prosecuted for murder. The observer notes in the report that “They didn’t have the ability to justify their case. For me the boys should be represented by a lawyer for fair judgement.” Failing to provide the defendant with legal representation limits the court’s ability to deliver a fair trial, and this problem is even more acute when the defendants are minors. 

The accused children are orphaned and homeless which means they don’t have the usual familial networks to rely on. As a result of the conflict in South Sudan, the amount of children without a home or family has increased. This court record suggests that this could be a widespread issue, where minors without family connections are being prosecuted without legal counsel. The case highlights a need for further investigation from humanitarian organisations to determine whether this is an isolated issue, or a more widespread problem.`,

          "This case concerned an Ethiopian refugee who had been in prison awaiting trial for manslaughter over a period of two years. The case highlights the difficulties faced by refugees without the money to pay court fines, and the apparent unwillingness of either the court or the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to resolve the issue.",
        comment: `This case was heard in a high court in Juba on 21 October 2015. The defendant is an Ethiopian refugee accused of vehicular manslaughter. The complainant, a distant relative of the deceased, initially brought the case two years prior. The case was adjourned nine times over a period of two years because the court was awaiting the appearance of the deceased’s close relatives, who did not appear each time the case was listed. 

The judge would not release the defendant on bail until the defendant paid blood compensation of 21000SSP ($73.68*) to the relatives of the deceased. The judge refused bail on the basis that the payment must be made first to the deceased relatives, otherwise the judge would be held responsible if the relatives later came to collect the payment. The defendant does not have any money themselves, or relatives to pay the fine on their behalf. Without being able to pay compensation, the defendant will remain in prison awaiting trial. This demonstrates how central familial relations are in resolving disputes, which can lead to problems in the absence of relatives of both parties. 

In the absence of the defendants’ relatives who, if present, would usually be responsible for the fine the judge argued that the UNHCR was responsible for the defendant and should therefore pay the compensation on his behalf. The UNHCR was contacted and refused to pay the fine stating that it was the responsibility of the individual. The judge ruled that the case would be adjourned again, and the deceased’s close relatives given another chance to appear at a relisted hearing on 23 November. 

Whilst it was agreed among participants that the UNHCR should be persuaded to take responsibility for the fine in the interests of justice, it was unclear what would happen if the relatives of the deceased could not be produced, even if the fine were collected. With the case unconcluded, the defendant was set to remain in prison. This demonstrates the difficulties displaced persons experience when they have to face a host country’s legal system with only minimal support, and the importance attached to the presence of relatives at court proceedings.

          "This case involves an administrative official who wrongly accused the complainant of a crime, resulting in the complainant being “beaten and detained for 21 days.” It highlights the complex ways which customary courts are embedded within the governance structures of the PoC and their potential to exert influence over other authorities in the site.",
        comment: `The case was heard on  29 April 2016 in the UN Juba PoC3 (Protection of Civilians site three.) The defendant is a camp chair (community administrative official) who is accused of wrongly reporting the complainant to the UN Police for being involved in an incident of fighting. As a result of the false accusation, the complainant was “beaten and detained for 21 days.” This case gives an insight into the complex ways customary courts are embedded within overlapping structures of governance.

As is referenced in other court records, corporal punishment is sometimes used by the various security groups within both PoCs and wider South Sudan. It is also not unheard of for customary courts to sentence people to corporal punishment, although this can also sometimes be avoided by paying a fine. The use of corporal punishment within a UN administered zone violates the UN Convention on Human Rights, demonstrating the limited capacity of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) to enforce the international human rights regime in South Sudan.
Customary courts have been created in PoCs by Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to try and create some degree of stability and legal governance, with seemingly tacit support from the UN. Specifically, this case shows how members of the community can resolve disputes with authority figures through the customary courts. In this case the judge ruled that the defendant was guilty of “unlawful administration” and fined him 7000SSP ($24.56*).  
This case is an example of the limited power and efficacy of customary courts within the current framework. The court had no oversight over the initial accusation and subsequent arrest and punishment.  It could only ensure that the complainant was compensated after the fact. Nor does the court appear to be able to exert influence over the forces responsible for the beating in this instance, as it was only the camp chair who was held responsible. 
This case also demonstrates how quickly customary courts can make rulings on cases. This case took one week to come to trial and lasted four hours. The speed at which Customary courts process cases comes from the necessity to resolve disputes before they escalate into violence. Customary courts provide IDPs with familiar and timely access to a hearing, in comparison to lengthy, opaque UN processes or statutory courts outside the PoC.

The case is unusual because the divorce was granted on the basis of a “constitutional right to separate,” whereas in other court records a divorce is not granted under similar circumstances.",
        comment: `This divorce case was heard in a customary B court in Juba on 9  December 2015. The complainant filed for divorce on the grounds that her husband was neglectful and had  substance abuse problems with alcohol and opium. Divorces are a sensitive issue in South Sudan. The custom of paying bride price (usually in the form of cows) to the relatives of a bride traditionally confers ‘ownership’ of a woman from her birth family to her husband, leading courts to consider women as property in divorce cases. 

This case demonstrates that some women can and do bring cases to customary courts, despite the fact that often in marriage disputes the wife is represented by a male relative. Customary courts and laws have been criticised for reproducing and enforcing patriarchal gender norms in South Sudan. However, the fact that some women are able and willing to bring cases to customary courts shows that the situation is more complex. The ability of women to bring their own cases to court suggests a recognition that they have some status and rights beyond that of being the property of their husbands or family.  It should be noted however that in this case both the husband himself and the families of both parties agreed to accept the divorce in court before the judgment was handed down. 

Divorces in customary courts are not usually granted unless there is agreement from both partners and support from the parents. Typically if a divorce is granted, the parents have agreed to pay back the cows or money they received from the husband, but here there is no mention of the parents paying back the bride price which represents a break from customary law. While the parents and the husband did not object to the divorce in this case, the judge granted the request as a “constitutional right to separate for good reason.” The framing of the judgement as a “constitutional right” as opposed to framing it within customary law shows that customary courts can draw on other legal frameworks to begin generating new gender relations.`,

          "This case came to Nimule County court (Statutory) on 13 January 2016. It highlights the complexity of processes of displacement in Eastern Africa.  While South Sudanese refugees were fleeing to neighbouring countries, seven Eritreans were caught and prosecuted for illegally crossing the Ugandan border at Nimule, apparently in search of opportunities for work in South Sudan.",
        comment: `The case traces aspects of seven Eritrean refugees’ predicament and the journey which led them to South Sudan. It reveals the precarious circumstances and the survival strategies of displaced persons from Eastern Africa, as well as the contemporary limits on claiming asylum. 

It also demonstrates that statutory courts in Nimule continued to function quite regularly despite South Sudan’s civil war. Yet there were limitations in their capacity to deliver a fair trial. Important to note is that the Eritrean defendants were not provided with any legal representation, and at least one of them was unable to speak English or any other language accepted in the court. The lack of legal representation and a translator demonstrates a failing of the statutory court system and occurs in other statutory court cases.

The Eritrean men were among the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled the authoritarian regime in their home country. The accused explained to the judge that they were in a camp in Israel before being deported to Rwanda by the Israeli authorities. Israel has allegedly signed deals with Uganda and Rwanda in which “The latter states agreed to receive Eritrean and Sudanese refugees in exchange for millions of dollars of grants and ambiguous ‘sales’ from Israel.” 
Displaced persons who are deported from Israel to Rwanda or Uganda have little support from the host governments, making them particularly vulnerable to people traffickers and exploitative labour contracts. After arriving in Rwanda, these refugees were taken to Uganda by businessmen who offered them work, yet they complained that they were not paid well, implying labour exploitation. This is a common issue for displaced persons who are vulnerable to people traffickers and exploitative labour contracts. 
The Eritreans then left Uganda for South Sudan after being told there were opportunities to earn US dollars. When they were caught by the military trying to cross the border, they presented their Rwandan documents and were detained and then brought to court. From the case notes, it is apparent that the military stole or misplaced their belongings, which included US$800 and two phones. Security services stealing or confiscating valuable items is an issue raised in other court records, but it appears that the court was either unwilling or unable to address this in this instance.
The judge fined the defendants 500SSP ($1.75*) each and sentenced them to three months in prison, before being turned over to the relevant immigration authorities for deportation. It is not clarified where they will be deported to. The case was unusual for the Nimule courts, but the defendants’ experiences are emblematic of the multiple vulnerabilities and uncertainties that characterize the lives of refugees and displaced people in Eastern Africa.

        summary:
          "This case was brought by the father of an underage girl who sought the separation of his daughter’s relationship with a 25-year-old boda-boda driver. The judgment in favor of the complainant ordered the families of the couple to perform a traditional separation ritual to end the relationship. The case highlights the way customary courts deal with family disputes between minors and adults.",
        comment: `This case was heard in a customary court in Nimule on 15 August 2015. It was brought to the court by the father of the underage girl to request that she be separated from the defendant on the grounds that they are related. 

This is one of many recorded court cases in which parents have brought cases to the courts in order to ensure their children obey their wishes. The plaintiff describes how his daughter went missing, and upon finding her he discovered that she was in a relationship with the defendant, and she claimed to be married to him. Unable to confront the defendant, he reported it to the local chief who said it would be forwarded to the police, however the plaintiff argued that because the couple were related it should be resolved without police involvement. Customary law typically states that parents have control over their children, especially in regard to marriage. 

Cases that involve relationships between minors and adults should be dealt with in a statutory court. Nonetheless, this case and others like it often end up being heard in customary courts. This can be for a variety of reasons: there may not be a statutory court that is accessible, or as in this case, families might decide that it would be more easily resolved in a customary court. In this instance, the plaintiff emphasized that he wished to avoid the involvement of the police, meanwhile others present at the hearing commented that it should have been a police matter as it involved a child under 18.  This demonstrates how the limitations of the statutory court system can lead to customary courts having to deal with violations they may not be equipped to deal with. 

The customary court ruled that the couple should be separated using a traditional Ma’di ceremony involving the slaughter of two goats. The defendant was ordered to pay compensation of 700SSP ($2.46*) to the girl’s family, and additionally to either pay a 300SSP ($1.05*) fine, do three months of community service, or serve three months in prison. 

By using a traditional ritual that is respected within the culture of the participants the issue can be resolved and the participants can get closure. The use of traditional rituals has appeared in other court records, and they demonstrate the way customary courts use this ritual as a common ground to resolve disputes.
