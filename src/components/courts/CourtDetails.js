          This case was heard in a customary court (B) in Nimule on 18 May 2016.
          The plaintiff asked the court to separate his daughter from the
          defendant who impregnated her. Customary law typically mandates that
          relatives have the right to decide who their children marry, but this
          case proves to be an exception to that rule. In line with the
          precedent of similar cases, the plaintiff attempted to use the
          customary court to ensure his daughter obeyed his wishes. He argued
          that his daughter’s pregnancy would put a stop to her education, which
          she should have been allowed to continue. This is a common concern for
          parents that appears in other court records. In line with the

          between valuing women’s education, yet potentially limiting their
          abilities to make decisions for themselves.
