        <h3>Courts</h3>
        <p>
          What happens in local courts matters not only for individuals or
          families, but also for communities and nations. Courts are influential
          institutions, which administer law and contribute to governing
          society, yet information about their processes and decisions is mostly
          inaccessible outside of their localities. This is especially true of
          conflict settings, where access to statutory justice is limited, and
          customary or religious laws and courts may adjudicate on all manner of
          local disputes, including criminal offences. Monitoring and
          documenting court proceedings can teach us about law, politics and
          society, including the grievances, inequalities and differences that
          fuel conflict.</p> 
          <p>Court cases illustrate the challenges of everyday life
          and the administration of the law and as such are of interest to
          citizens and researchers alike. We summarize and comment upon selected
          cases from South Sudan and Somalia. The cases reveal the
          realities of legal pluralism in practice, featuring diverse social and
          political problems, and creative or repressive responses to them. Read
          case summaries here
