    content: `<h3>William: Promoting child rights in Kapoeta, South Sudan </h3>
    <p>William sees it is vital to educate children and young people about their legal rights under statutory law. In October 2019, he used his paralegal training to support the work of Root of Generations (ROG) in Kapoeta, a South Sudanese NGO that focuses on empowering women and children in both urban and rural areas. Women and children are particularly vulnerable to injustice, with one of the key issues being around the customary tradition of arranged marriages in exchange for a bride price. In Kapoeta state, this has led to young girls (12–15 years) being married to significantly older men without the opportunity for education, or the knowledge of their right to be protected from early marriage under the 2008 Child Act.  
</p>
<p>William collaborated with ROG and the state Ministry of Information, Culture, Youth and Sport, to arrange a meeting on 19 October 2019 with a local youth group to discuss the challenges faced by young people and inform them of their legal rights under the 2008 Child Act. The outcomes and recommendations of this meeting were discussed by a youth representative on a community radio show in order to raise awareness throughout the community. The young people identified issues around forced marriage, sexual abuse, unemployment and land grabbing. William gave a presentation on the 2008 Child Act, informing those in attendance on their rights to be protected from early marriage and child abuse, as well as how to report instances of abuse. The meeting identified several recommendations including:  a continued need to raise awareness of children’s legal rights; the necessity for civil society to provide legal aid to young people; and the need for the government to economically empower young people to help combat unemployment.</p>
<p>William supported ROG in its handling of an ongoing case regarding a nine-year-old girl who was forced by her father to marry a fifty-six-year-old man in exchange for five cows. The man sexually assaulted the girl multiple times before she managed to escape, seeking refuge at the ROG compound. The ROG staff notified the police, who subsequently detained the girls’ father, but failed to apprehend the man who had fled. William was informed by ROG staff and advised them to carefully document the case themselves in order to ensure the perpetrators were brought to justice and to find a safer place for the girl; as sending her back to her family would put her at risk. The court ruled that the father would remain in jail until the man was apprehended to stand trial. As of yet, the man has not been found. ROG were able to find foster parents for the girl while the case is ongoing. </p>
<p>Cases like this demonstrate the importance of William’s and ROG’s work. A lack of awareness and understanding of child rights among the population has meant that young girls and boys are vulnerable to early marriages and other abuses. Compounding this problem is the lack of statutory legal infrastructure to enforce and uphold children’s rights, especially in rural areas where the practice of forced marriages is common. Thus, many cases end up in customary courts and are dealt with in accordance with customary law, which tends to uphold parents’ customary rights over the statutory rights of children. </p>`,

    content: `<h3> Onyango: Working to promote women’s rights in Nimule, South Sudan </h3>
    <p>Onyango is a trained paralegal who is committed to improving the rights of women in his community in Nimule including as regards property ownership and inheritance, the poor living standards women face in prison, and sexual assault cases. In October 2019, Onyango organised a meeting in a village in Nimule to discuss women's rights to property ownership and inheritance, along with a number of community activists; and with the assistance of a local chief. </p>

<p>The rights of women in South Sudan were only recently enshrined in statutory law and in reality they continue to be systematically violated or undermined in many areas of life. The 2011 Constitution of South Sudan states in the Land Article 16(5) that women have a right to the estate of their deceased husbands along with any surviving heirs. However, the relatives of deceased husbands often deny women the right to their husbands’ inheritance and claim the property for themselves. The meeting discussed how women are perceived as being attached to their husbands, yet not part of the family in themselves. Participants also addressed the societal view that women do not contribute to the assets of a man's family, and therefore should not inherit their husband's property. By spreading awareness of women's constitutional right to inherit and own property and the ways that they can report breaches of this right, Onyango’s meeting helped to challenge these assumptions. He worked to empower women to assert their rights both by educating them in the law, and by involving a customary authority, knowing that in many localities chiefs’ courts routinely discriminate against women. </p>

<p>South Sudan's prison system was severely impacted during the civil war. As a result, much of the infrastructure was destroyed, leaving the remaining facilities overcrowded and in dire need of improvement. Onyango and a few paralegals organised a visit to the Nimule prison in December 2019, on International Human Rights Day. The objective of the visit was to talk with the prisoners about the importance of human rights, and to start building social relationships and a dialogue with the prisoners. Additionally, the female paralegals brought menstrual products for the women, which are not supplied by the prison. The female prisoners raised a number of concerns about their living conditions in prison, namely the lack of sleeping space, poor or non-existent sanitary facilities, lack of food, and lack of menstrual products. Onyango aimed to communicate these issues to government officials as part of an effort to improve the prisoners' situation. The prisoners also requested that the paralegals visit the prison again in future to continue to educate prisoners on their legal rights. </p>

<p>Onyango has also been observing and recording court cases. Women often face challenges in both statutory and customary courts particularly around sexual assault. Onyango observed a high court case regarding sexual assault in Nimule on the 24 October 2019. The defendant was a 22-year-old male teacher, accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old student who became pregnant as a result of the rape. The defendant was found guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison and to pay compensation of five cows and two sheep to the father of the girl. The prison sentence was shortened because he is the only man in the family, and therefore the primary source of income for his family. The court ruled in the woman’s favour, but also balanced the sentence based on the financial and familial context of the accused. This is illustrative of the complex decisions that customary courts must make. Observing and recording cases serves two purposes, firstly it encourages the court to follow the appropriate procedures and laws. Secondly, it helps activists and researchers better understand how cases in specific areas are ruled on.

    <h3>Okeny: Promoting legal empowerment at community level in Torit, South Sudan </h3>
    <p>Okeny is concerned about access to justice in his community in Torit. In December 2019, he organised a community meeting  to improve understanding of the justice system and discuss some of the challenges that face it. Participants reflected on their experiences and discussed recommendations for improving the justice system, particularly focusing on customary courts.</p>
<p>South Sudan's judicial system has changed throughout the periods of conflict and is often only accessible through customary courts. As a legal activist and court observer, Okeny outlined the distinction between customary courts and statutory courts and the types of cases each court hears. This included a discussion on the legal rights in a court, and those outlined in South Sudan’s Bill of Rights, which was enshrined in statutory law as part of the provisional constitution in 2011. This was aimed at giving attendees a better working understanding of the provision of law. </p>
<p>The meeting discussed some of the issues within the customary court system that undermine the process of justice. A widespread problem in South Sudan is the weakening of the authority of community leaders when court rulings are ignored by armed men or subverted by corruption. The lack of a functioning police force often exacerbates this issue, making it difficult for customary courts to enforce their rulings if they are not supported by a specific part of the community. Additionally, concerns over nepotism were expressed in the meeting, saying that chiefs who rule in favour of relatives or friends can lead to divides in the community and even to violence.</p>
<p>A number of recommendations emerged from the meeting. One was the creation of a community framework based on the rights enshrined in the South Sudanese constitution, and international human rights. The framework would help guide customary courts and facilitate sharing of knowledge and experiences between courts across the country. A second recommendation was the training of more paralegals to assist customary courts, with the aim to  improve the legal grounding of the courts. This would also help make courts more inclusive of the wider community by providing opportunities for young people and women to be involved in the justice system. Both improvements would be supported by a more robust police force to help enforce court rulings and provide security for customary courts. </p>
<p>The discussion that Okeny facilitated is an important step in improving South Sudan's justice system. Engaging the community to discuss the issues within customary courts, and suggest improvements, is a useful endeavor to guide the efforts of activists, researchers, and pressure groups towards reforming the justice system. </p>`,

    content: `<h3>Tot, Nhial and Peter: Working together to empower forcibly displaced young people in in South Sudan</h3>
    <p>A group of three activists, Tot, Nhial and Peter, who were forced out of their homes by massacres in December 2013, are concerned about the rights of other displaced young people in their camp. They used their paralegal training and creative talents to organise an awareness-raising activity for young people living in the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Protection of Civilians (PoC3) site on 28 January 2020. They informed participants about their rights in relation to two prevalent problems affecting them: forced underage marriages, and a lack of access to education. They wanted young people in the PoC to understand the laws surrounding these issues, and some of the ways they could seek assistance in dealing with them, either through the justice system, or NGOs. </p>
<p>Young people, especially girls, are at significant risk of being forced into marriages by their parents. This can often occur when the child is legally underage. In 2017, South Sudan had the 7th highest rate of child marriages in the world; with 52% of children married by 18 and 9% of children married by 15. Underage marriages are illegal according to the 2008 Child Act which protects the rights of children under statutory law. These marriages often happen because parents stand to gain financially from marrying off their daughters for a bride price, and customary law states that children are the property of their parents.</p>
<p>Tot, Nhial and Peter explained to the young people at the meeting that underage marriages result in psychological damage, abuse, and in some cases suicide. They used drama to explore this issue, getting the young people to act out stories of forced marriages and the dynamics surrounding them. They advised the attendees on how to report a forced marriage to the authorities, and get the case referred to a court. They also gave advice on how to reach out to relatives and community figures for assistance in situations where legal alternatives are not possible.</p>
<p>The second part of the meeting addressed the importance of education for young people. According to a UNICEF report, 2.2 million school-aged children in South Sudan were out of school in 2019, with 30% of the countries’ schools unable to operate due to damages or closures. The organisers encouraged the young people to remain in education, advising that it would benefit them later in life. Common reasons for a child dropping out of school are the family’s lack of funds to pay school fees, or, for children who are orphans or have been separated from their parents, the lack of a sponsor. In order to help children dealing with these issues, the activists advised that they should seek help from either the school or NGOs.</p>
<p>Young people are extremely vulnerable in South Sudan. Tot, Nhial and Peter know this from experience, having themselves been forced to seek protection in the PoC. Their initiative shows how forcibly displaced people can act as agents of change, providing young people in their community with the information they urgently need to cope with present challenges, while encouraging them to imagine a better future.</p>`,
